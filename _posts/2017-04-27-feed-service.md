Today we are proud to announce a new feature of our API: **Feed**. 

Feed is a websocket server that allows users to subscribe to multiple criteria and recieve live matches that fit that criteria. More information available in the [Feed documentation](https://github.com/odota/core/blob/master/docs/feed.md).
