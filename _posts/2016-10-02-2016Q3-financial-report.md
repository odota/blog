It's Q4, which means it's time to look back on our financial situation over the last three months.

The jist: things are looking good!

Additionally, we brought in $1192 in advertising and sponsorships.

## August

We spent $1434.97 on servers and an additional $42 on domain costs.

We received $512 in donations with $126.56 in fees. Finally, we received $2554.19 in advertising
and sponsorships.

We spent $1429.48 on servers, but received $468 in Cheese with $99.26 in fees.

We received $2013.15 in advertising and sponsorships.

## Summary

OpenDota has now just over $2000 lifetime earnings. Sponsorships and advertising have really
brought in some revenue for us which has now given us a small rainy-day fund for now. We hope
that this revenue maintains itself so that we have more income stability and more money to invest
in improving OpenDota.

Thanks for your continued support!
