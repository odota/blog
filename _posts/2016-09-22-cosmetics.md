Wow, that PA looked so cool! I wonder what she was wearing...

Never fear; OpenDota is here! One new feature pushed tonight: we've added a listing on the match pages of all the cosmetic items present in that match (organized by the player owning the particular cosmetic). A nice example can be seen here at [/matches/2660724143/**cosmetics**](https://www.opendota.com/matches/2660724143/cosmetics). Here's to hoping that you'll never again be plagued by hollow memories of *hats* you wish you had! :')

Also, a huge shoutout to community developer [@alexbarrett](https://github.com/alexbarrett) for his fixes to the query form alignment! :D

Cheers,

~ The OpenDota Team
